Masks.
  --  Make GAIA star mask catalogue with make_gaia.py
      /masks/

Targets.
  --  Split .mtl with mtl_bytile.
      /mtls/

Assigned. 
  --  Get assigned targets with get_assigned.py
      /fiberassign/ 

Truth.
  --  Copy necessary truth cats. to scratch with get_truth.py
      /truth/
      /truth/legacy
    
  --  Standardise RA, DEC and Z columns with standardise_truth.py & standardise_truth_im.py
      /truth/standard/

      Note:  the above truth files are line matched to /truth/.  No need to standardise LS.  

  --  Get assigned truth with assigned_truth.py
      /truth/assigned/

      Note:  combined with standardised redshift and legacy columns. 

  --  Split assigned truth by tile with assigned_truth_bytile.
